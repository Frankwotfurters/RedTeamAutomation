      This script will gather all JavaScript files loaded by a page and scan them for known vulnerabilities. This is done 
      with the help of <a href="https://github.com/FallibleInc/retirejslib">RetireJS (Python)</a>. Additionally, it will 
      perform banner grabbing to determine the web server used, for example nginx or Apache, and potentially its version 
      and searches the <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/">National Vulnerability Database (NVD)</a> for related CVEs.

<h3>About:</h3>
<p>
  Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities is a very widespread issue among web applications. Many development teams 
  may not even understand what components or modules they are using due to a large amount of components being implemented. 
  Keeping such components up-to-date is an even harder task.
</p>

<h3>Impact:</h3>
<p>
  Some vulnerabilities lead to only minor impacts, however, some of the largest breaches that have occured leveraged known 
  vulnerabilities in components. The impact depends on the assets at risk.
