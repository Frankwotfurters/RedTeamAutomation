  <h1>Cross-Site Scripting Scanner</h1>

  <h3>Note:</h3>
  <h3>The scanner will detect for any Cross-Site Scripting related vulnerabilities. Robotic Process Automation (RPA) Demonstration is available during the scan. However, due to limitations of the RPA tool, the user will need to click on the popup triggered by the script.</h3>
  <h3>About:</h3>
  <p>Cross-site scripting (also known as XSS) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to compromise the interactions that users have with a vulnerable application. It allows an attacker to circumvent the same origin policy, which is designed to segregate different websites from each other. Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities normally allow an attacker to masquerade as a victim user, to carry out any actions that the user is able to perform, and to access any of the user's data. If the victim user has privileged access within the application, then the attacker might be able to gain full control over all of the application's functionality and data.</p>
  <h3>Impact:</h3>
  <p>Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities continue to remain a major threat to web applications as attackers exploiting XSS attacks can gain control of the userâ€™s account and steal personal information such as passwords, bank account numbers, credit card info, personally identifiable information (PII), social security numbers, and more.</p>
