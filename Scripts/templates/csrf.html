    <p>
      Please provide the login page to the web app as the Target URL.
      <br><br>
      This script will run an authenticated crawl through the website and find every form. It then checks if the form has
      a hidden input field or requires a token. If not, it is deemed as potentially vulnerable to CSRF. A Proof-of-Concept
       (PoC) is then generated and saved to the local file system for further manual testing.
      <br><br>
      Robotic Process Automation (RPA) Demonstration is available during the scan. The RPA tool will showcase the login and
       crawling phases.

<h3>About:</h3>
<p>
  Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack that makes an authenticated user perform an action on a web application 
  unknowingly. This attack only works when the user is already authenticated on the web application.
</p>

<h3>Impact:</h3>
<p>
  If the attack is successfully executed, the victim will be forced to perform an unwanted action on their account, such as 
  the changing of password or transfer of funds.
