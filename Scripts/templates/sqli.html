<h3>About:</h3>
<p>
  SQL injection is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries that an
  application makes to its database. It generally allows an attacker to view data that they are not normally able to
  retrieve. This might include data belonging to other users, or any other data that the application itself is able to
  access. In many cases, an attacker can modify or delete this data, causing persistent changes to the application's
  content or behavior.
  In some situations, an attacker can escalate an SQL injection attack to compromise the underlying server or other
  back-end infrastructure, or perform a denial-of-service attack.
</p>

<h3>Impact:</h3>
<p>
  A successful SQL injection attack can result in unauthorized access to sensitive data, such as passwords, credit card
  details, or personal user information. Many high-profile data breaches in recent years have been the result of SQL
  injection attacks, leading to reputational damage and regulatory fines. In some cases, an attacker can obtain a
  persistent backdoor into an organization's systems, leading to a long-term compromise that can go unnoticed for an
  extended period.
