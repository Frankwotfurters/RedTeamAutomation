<h1>Our Aim:</h1>
<P>To simplify red teaming processes, while maintaining the highest level of efficiency and accuracy.</P>
<hr>

<h1>Who are we:</h1>

<h1>What is RPA Integrated RTA:</h1>
<p>RPA Integrated RTA is essentially a red team automation tool developed to aid auditors in security testing. 
    However, this is different from other tools as Robotic Process Automation has been integrated into all the scanners. 
    Scanners were developed using Python programming and RPA with Python (TagUI) integration. 
    Tasks such as capturing a screenshot, writing information to files or even launching a PDF report after a 
    scan has all been automated with RPA. 
    Effectively minimising the userâ€™s tasks to the minimum.</p>
